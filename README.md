# pilotApp-ReactNative


This is a React Native application.
Was developed to connect a SD card into a Garmin1000 airplaine hardware.
With this app we get log files from the SD connected in the Garmin.
We process that information and save the files into the phones.
Then when the user has Internet connection again the app upload the files into a server.
